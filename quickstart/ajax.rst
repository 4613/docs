Ajax has been a buzzword around for some time now (as far as you could call some time a lot of time ;) ) and is one of the concepts which have changed the development for the web quite drastically. 

Dojo provides a solid set of battle-tested XHR wrapper functions to allow you to build Ajax interactions with confidence, use a unified API, and handle forms with ease. These APIs are built into Dojo Base, so you can use them in any page that includes dojo.js. Read on to learn how easy it is to build powerful Ajax interactions with Dojo.

The XMLHTTP request object (XHR for short) is one of the basic building blocks for constructing responsive Ajax-drive interactions. By allowing you to retrieve data on the user's behalf without refreshing the whole page the XHR object provides tremendous, but cross-browser XHR usage is beset by memory leaks, divergent APIs, a lack of built-in form encoding from JavaScript, and painful corner cases when de-serializing response data.
