Dojo documentation

* Decide on final solution for data export and wiki svn integration. Current options are:

  * Wait for moinmoin 2.0 which will have wiki <=> svn support and way better templating mechanism
  * Build a middleware to handle wiki to svn integration and fix sphinx issues

* Clean up navigation
* Restructure general doc contents (Still way to complicated to get started)
