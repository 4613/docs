5 A11y Requirements
===================

Below are the 5 basic Dojo Accessibility requirements which must be met when creating and styling user interface components. Each Dojo developer and designer are required to implement accessibility for dijit components. The folks with a11y experience will help but it is each developer's responsibility to understand and follow these guidelines. If you need help with a11y, create a trac ticket with the category a11y-review but remember that it is not the a11y team's job to implement accessibility for you!

**Visual**

  + `Identification and interaction with visual elements does not rely on color alone <#interaction-does-NOT-rely-on-color-alone>`_
  + `All functionality is perceivable without color or Images <#perceivable-without-color-or-images>`_
  + `All functionality is visible and usable at various font sizes <#visible-at-various-font-sizes>`_

**Functional**

  + `All functionality is usable via the mouse and keyboard <#usable-via-the-mouse-and-keyboard>`_
  + `All functionality is enabled for assistive technology <#enabled-for-assistive-technology>`_

Note that this is not a comprehensive list of Web Accessibility requirements, just the list of items most likely to be encountered by a Dojo Designer or Developer. For complete Accessibility Guidelines see:

  + `W3C Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0 <http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/>`_
  + `US Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act <http://www.section508.gov/>`_
  + `W3C provided list of accessibility policies around the world <http://www.w3.org/WAI/Policy/>`_
