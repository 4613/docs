===================
5 A11y Requirements
===================

Below are the 5 basic Dojo Accessibility requirements which must be met when creating and styling user interface components. Each Dojo developer and designer are required to implement accessibility for dijit components. The folks with a11y experience will help but it is each developer's responsibility to understand and follow these guidelines. If you need help with a11y, create a trac ticket with the category a11y-review but remember that it is not the a11y team's job to implement accessibility for you!
