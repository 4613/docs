TODOC - additional details

First, download a source distribution from http://download.dojotoolkit.org/ or checkout the source from SVN.

Next, go to the utils/buildscripts directory and run the following command:

.. code-block :: text
  
  ./build.sh profile=standard action=release

Assuming you have java installed, after some time your dojo build will reside in ../../release/dojo
