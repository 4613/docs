Lets get this party started
===========================
So the Wiki is up the next phase would be to discuss:

1. What should be on it (and write a page about it here)
2. How it should be structured (see bellow for a beginning of this)
3. Choose some monitors from the community to watch changes and revert destructive behaviour.
4. Open it up to the wider community

Perhaps an IRC meeting to talk about each of these would be a good idea?

Structure
~~~~~~~~~
This is great. Now some of the tutorials such as the DnD one can be updated to work in Dojo 1.0 etc. I wouldn't hold back until its all pretty, that can happen at anytime now. Lets just get it up and started. I guess the things that have to be considered are:

1. Structure, so:

  * Q.A. in the IRC can be put up quickly and in the right place. 
  * Articles/tutorials can find their place and be updated/corrected as they are used/reused. 
  * API doc/notes can find their place.

2. Dojo versions (so its clear what article is relavent to which verion of Dojo)


Perhaps ideas about these things can start to go up and then be organised into groups naturally as they form instead of trying to predict how this will be used and forcing the content into some unnatural order. 

What happened to the notes from the last temp. Wiki on structure?

Questions
---------

1. IS there anyway to import this: http://docs.google.com/View?docid=d764479_11fcs7s397
   with like some sort of screen scrpper. Would make sucking part or all of the documentation lying around fast and easy?
