DojoC
=====

DojoC is DojoCampus's "personal" subversion repository, also known as DojoCommunity repo. It acts as a sandbox for committers and contributors to work together in a public area. 

There is no 'versioning' taking place in DojoC, it is all provided via subversion from a single url:

``http://svn.dojotoolkit.org/dojoc/``

All work in DojoC is still covered under Contributor License Agreement (`CLA <http://dojotoolkit.org/cla>`_), so if you would like write access and have a CLA on file, contact a Campus Editor in #dojo (irc.freenode.net)
