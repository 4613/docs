DojoC is an svn repository used by DojoCampus for a variety of widgets, tutorials, sandbox, and other demos. You are welcome to explore and contribute, though absolutely nothing is guaranteed to work. DojoC is meant as a community workshop, and code comes and goes frequently, often times 'promoted' to `DojoX projects <dojox>`_.
