dojox.grid.EnhancedGrid.plugins
===============================

:Project owner: Nathan Toone
:Available: since V.1.6

EnhancedGrid provides a plugin framework, which can support a rich set of new features as plugins.
The followings are implemented in Dojo 1.6:

* Filter
* Export Grid to CSV
* Print Grid
* Row/Column/Cell Extended Selection
* Row/Column/Cell DnD
* Pagination
* Merge Cells within a Row
* Persistance of Column Width/Sorting/Order
* Search using Regular Expressions

These features are loaded on demand, so they must be required and declared before being used.
