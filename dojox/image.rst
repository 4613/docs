The DojoX Image project provides a number of image-related widgets as extensions to Dijit, such as a Lightbox, SlideShow, FlickrBadge, among others. The goal is to provide a common way of handling images, though some Image project widgets are designed for edge-cases, like the Magnifier.

Most widgets within this project are experimental.
