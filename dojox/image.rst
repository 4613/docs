The DojoX Image project provides a number of image-related widgets as extensions to Dijit, such as a Lightbox, SlideShow, FlickrBadge, among others. The goal is to provide a common way of handling images, though some Image project widgets are designed for edge-cases, like the Magnifier.

Most widgets within this project are experimental.

Core API
========

Prior to Dojo 1.3, no "core API" was provided. Newer versions include helper functions, available by loading the dojox.image module:

.. code-block :: javascript
  :linenos:

  dojo.require("dojox.image");

Preloading Images
-----------------

When setting an image to a new src="" attribute, if the image has not been cached by the browser, there will be a delay before the new image is seen. This can be significant if the images are large or the connection is slow. In DojoX Image package, a function ``preload`` is provided to load these images off-screen. It is a very simple function, and does not do any notification about image readiness. All browsers treat a unique image url as one, so the image will be already loading if someone attempts to view image you are preloading. 

Just pass an array of url's to the function:

.. code-block :: javascript
  :linenos:

  // must be after dom ready:
  dojo.require("dojox.image");
  dojo.addOnLoad(function(){
      dojox.image.preload(["pic.png", "face.jpg", "http://example.com/logo.gif"]);
  }); 

Alternately, you can specify a list of url's as an array to a dojoConfig parameter before dojo.js is loaded with the `preloadImages` option:

.. code-block :: javascript
  :linenos:

  var dojoConfig = { 
      preloadImages:["foo.jpg", "bar.png"]
  }
