TODO: short summary of the component/class/method

A widget for rotating through child nodes using transitions.

============
Introduction
============

TODO: introduce the component/class/method

A small, fast, extensible, awesome rotator that cycles, with transitions, through panes (child nodes) displaying only one at a time and ties into controllers used to change state. The Rotator does not rely on dijit.  It is designed to be as lightweight as possible.  Controllers and transitions have been externalized so builds can be as optimized with only the components you want to use. 

For best results, each rotator pane should be the same height and width as the Rotator container node and consider setting overflow to hidden. While the Rotator will accept any DOM node for a rotator pane, a block element or element with display:block is recommended.
