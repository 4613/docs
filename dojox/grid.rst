Grids are familiar in the client/server development world. Basically a grid is a kind of mini spreadsheet, commonly used to display details on master-detail forms. From HTML terms, a grid is a "super-table" with its own scrollable viewport.

Dojo Toolkit offers four different Grid widgets:

* `dojox.grid.DataGrid <dojox/grid/DataGrid>`_

  A visual grid/table much like a spreadsheet.

* `dojox.grid.EnhancedGrid <dojox/grid/EnhancedGrid>`_

  An enhanced version of the base grid, which extends it in numerous useful ways. ``New in 1.4``

* `dojox.grid.TreeGrid <dojox/grid/TreeGrid>`_

  This grid offers support for collapsable rows and model-based (`dijit.tree.ForestStoreModel <dijit/tree/ForestStoreModel>`_) structure. ``New in 1.4``

* the old dojox.grid.Grid

  This old version is only available for compatible reasons. It is now bundled in the dojox/grid directory as a tarball archive for those who would like to continue using the deprecated (V1.1) Grid.
