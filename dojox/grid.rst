Grids are familiar in the client/server development world. Basically a grid is a kind of mini spreadsheet, commonly used to display details on master-detail forms. From HTML terms, a grid is a "super-table" with its own scrollable viewport.

Dojo Toolkit offers four different Grid widgets:

* `dojox.grid.DataGrid <dojox/grid/DataGrid>`_
* `dojox.grid.EnhancedGrid <dojox/grid/EnhancedGrid>`_
* `dojox.grid.TreeGrid <dojox/grid/TreeGrid>`_
* the old dojox.grid.Grid - only available for compatible reasons
  This old version is now bundled in the dojox/grid directory as a tarball archive for those who would like to continue using the deprecated (V1.1) Grid.
