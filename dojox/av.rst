DojoX A/V aims to bring audio and video capabilities to the Open Web, first by wrapping common media types (Flash and Quicktime) and then by providing easy to use objects to accomplish basic A/V tasks.  As of version 0.1, only the base is included (Flash and Quicktime embedding mechanisms); in the near future, usable objects will appear, both in raw programmatic form and also with Dijit-compatible wrappers.
