Introduction
============

dijit/place is used to place one DOMNode relative to another DOMNode, or specified rectangle.   It is mainly used internally by dijit, by the `dijit.popup <dijit/popup>`_ code and by `dijit.Menu <dijit/Menu>`_ for displaying context menus.

======
Around
======

Place.around() positions one node relative to another.

Hereâ€™s an example that tries to put a popup tooltip either to the right, or as a fallback (if there is no room on the right), then on the left, of a textbox:

.. code-block :: javascript
 :linenos:

     require(["dijit/place"], function(place){
         place.around(tooltip, textbox, ["after", "before"]
     });



The possible values for the position parameter are:

	* before: places drop down to the left of the anchor node/widget, or to the right in the case of RTL scripts like Hebrew and Arabic
	* after: places drop down to the right of the anchor node/widget, or to the left in the case of RTL scripts like Hebrew and Arabic
	* above-centered: drop down is centered above anchor node
	* above: drop down goes above anchor node, left sides aligned
	* above-alt: drop down goes above anchor node, right sides aligned
	* below-centered: drop down is centered above anchor node
	* below: drop down goes below anchor node
	* below-alt: drop down goes below anchor node, right sides aligned

At

Place.at() positions a node with one corner at a specified position.

Here's an example of showing a context menu aligning one of the corners with the mouse position.   It picks a corner such that the menu can be displayed fully within the viewport:

.. code-block :: javascript
 :linenos:

     require(["dijit/place"], function(place){
         place.at(menu, {x: mouse.x, y: mouse.y}, ["TL", "BL", "TR", "BR"]);

The possible values for the position parameter, which specifies the corner of the popup node, are:

	* "BL" - bottom left
	* "BR" - bottom right
	* "TL" - top left
	* "TR" - top right
