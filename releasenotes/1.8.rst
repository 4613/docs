DateTextBox
-----------
DateTextBox's drop down Calendar no longer automatically opens upon clicking the input area, unless the hasDownArrow=false option is set (in which case that's the only way to open the drop down Calendar).

Dialog
------
Sizing improved for when Dialog is too big to fit in viewport.   Also, sizing automatically adjusts if users resizes the browser window.
