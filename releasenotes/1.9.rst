Browser Support
===============

The following browsers have been tested and are supported in this release. If a browser version is not listed as
supported, it still may work, especially on browsers with rapid release cycles (Chrome, Firefox). Future minor releases
of Dojo might include fixes to support future releases of these browsers, but we cannot guarantee it.

**Desktop**

* Firefox 3.6-12

* Safari 5-6

* Chrome 13-21

* IE 6-9

* Opera 10.50-12 (Dojo core only)

**Mobile (dojox/mobile)**

* iOS 4.x, 5.x (Mobile Safari) and 6.x (including all Dijit widgets except Editor)

* Android 2.2-2.3, 3.1-3.2, 4.0-4.1

* Blackberry 6-7

* Mobile compatibility on desktop browsers: IE 8-9, Firefox 4-12, Safari 5-6, Chrome 13-19

TODO: Link to page with specific vendor device models tested on

**Server-Side Platforms**

* While not a browser, Dojo 1.8 also works inside Node 0.6.x and 0.8.x.

Dojo
====


Dijit
=====

Declaration
-----------
Declaration now supports <script type="dojo/aspect">, in addition to the <script type="dojo/connect"> syntax
which is now deprecated (and will be removed for 2.0).   Ex:

.. js ::

	<div data-dojo-type="dijit/Declaration" data-dojo-props='widgetClass:"MyWidget"'>
		<script type="dojo/aspect" data-dojo-method="startup" data-dojo-advice="before">
			...
		</script>


DojoX
=====

dojox/charting
--------------

   * Threshold indicators (dojox/charting/plot2d/Indicator) can now easily be drawn on top of the chart.
   * Axis (dojox/charting/axis2d/Default) now supports rendering ticks inside of the plot area instead of outside of the axis. For that specify a negative length for the ticks.
  

dojox/app
---------
In 1.8 dojox/app would automatically require a model and mvc controller if it was listed in the config and not included in the list of dependencies.  In 1.9 the model and mvc controller will need to be listed in the dependencies. For example:

.. js ::

	"dependencies": [
		"dojox/app/utils/simpleModel",
		"dojox/app/utils/mvcModel",
		"dojox/mvc/EditStoreRefListController",
		: : :

dojox/calendar
--------------

In dojo 1.8, the Date constructor was used as last resort to decode a Date string. 
In dojo 1.9, as it is not reliable, the Date constructor is not used, and time.newDate() will throw an error if parameter is string and it cannot be decoded using ISO decoder (dojo/date/stamp).
