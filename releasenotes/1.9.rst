Browser Support
===============

The following browsers have been tested and are supported in this release. If a browser version is not listed as
supported, it still may work, especially on browsers with rapid release cycles (Chrome, Firefox). Future minor releases
of Dojo might include fixes to support future releases of these browsers, but we cannot guarantee it.

**Desktop**

* Firefox 3.6-12

* Safari 5-6

* Chrome 13-21

* IE 6-9

* Opera 10.50-12 (Dojo core only)

**Mobile (dojox/mobile)**

* iOS 4.x, 5.x (Mobile Safari) (including all Dijit widgets except Editor)

* Android 2.2-2.3, 3.1-3.2, 4.0-4.1

* Blackberry 6-7

* Mobile compatibility on desktop browsers: IE 8-9, Firefox 4-12, Safari 5-6, Chrome 13-19

Declaration
-----------
Declaration now supports <script type="dojo/aspect">, in addition to the <script type="dojo/connect"> syntax
which is now deprecated (and will be removed for 2.0).   Ex:

.. js ::

	<div data-dojo-type="dijit/Declaration" data-dojo-props='widgetClass:"MyWidget"'>
		<script type="dojo/aspect" data-dojo-method="startup" data-dojo-advice="before">
			...
		</script>
