Browser Support
===============

The following browsers have been tested and are supported in this release. If a browser version is not listed as
supported, it still may work, especially on browsers with rapid release cycles (Chrome, Firefox). Future minor releases
of Dojo might include fixes to support future releases of these browsers, but we cannot guarantee it.

**Desktop**

* Firefox 3.6-17

* Safari 5-6

* Chrome 13-23

* IE 6-10

* Opera 10.50-12 (Dojo core only)

**Mobile (dojox/mobile)**

* iOS 4.x, 5.x (Mobile Safari) and 6.x (including all Dijit widgets except Editor)

* Android 2.2-2.3, 3.1-3.2, 4.0-4.2 (Platform browser)

* BlackBerry 6-7 & 10 (Platform browser)

* Mobile compatibility on desktop browsers: IE 8-10, Firefox 4-17, Safari 5-6, Chrome 13-23

TODO: Link to page with specific vendor device models tested on

**Server-Side Platforms**

* While not a browser, Dojo 1.8 also works inside Node 0.6.x and 0.8.x.

Dojo
====


Dijit
=====

dijit/BackgroundIframe
----------------------
There's now a "config-bgIframe" has() flag that can be used to explicitly turn on/off the background iframe behind popups
that's useful when a page contains applets, and also for older versions of IE with the bleed through select problem.
Usage is:

.. html ::

	<script type="text/javascript" src="../../dojo/dojo.js"
		data-dojo-config="has: {'config-bgIframe': true}"></script>

It can also be specified as a build parameter in the staticHasFlags section.

By default it's turned on for desktop pages, but turned off for mobile.

dijit/Declaration
-----------------
Declaration now supports <script type="dojo/aspect">, in addition to the <script type="dojo/connect"> syntax
which is now deprecated (and will be removed for 2.0).   Ex:

.. js ::

	<div data-dojo-type="dijit/Declaration" data-dojo-props='widgetClass:"MyWidget"'>
		<script type="dojo/aspect" data-dojo-method="startup" data-dojo-advice="before">
			...
		</script>


DojoX
=====

dojox/charting
--------------

   * Threshold indicators (dojox/charting/plot2d/Indicator) can now easily be drawn on top of the chart.
   * Axis (dojox/charting/axis2d/Default) now supports rendering ticks inside of the plot area instead of outside of the axis. For that specify a negative length for the ticks.
   * Mouse indicator action (dojox/charting/action2d/MouseIndicator) now support over mode in addition to mouse drag. The mouse indicator can also be further customized (ability to remove the label, ...).
   * Grids (dojox/charting/plot2d/Grid) now supports grid stripes in addition to grid lines.
   * Ability to render labels on data points for Bubble/Columns/Default/Scatter plots by setting labels property to true.
   * Tooltip on stacked plots now display the value of the hovered data point not of the stacked value. One can go back to previous behavior if needed by customizing the text function of the Tooltip action.
  

dojox/app
---------

*Features*

dojox/app now provides a build system extension that allows you to easily build your application from the 
config file. 

*Incompatibilities*

In 1.8 dojox/app would automatically require a model and mvc controller if it was listed in the config and not included in the list of dependencies.  In 1.9 the model and mvc controller will need to be listed in the dependencies. For example:

.. js ::

	"dependencies": [
		"dojox/app/utils/simpleModel",
		"dojox/app/utils/mvcModel",
		"dojox/mvc/EditStoreRefListController",
		: : :

dojox/calendar
--------------

  * In 1.8, the Date constructor was used as last resort to decode a Date string. In 1.9, as it is not reliable, the Date constructor is not used, and time.newDate() will throw an error if parameter is string and it cannot be decoded using ISO decoder (dojo/date/stamp).

  * In 1.8, the renderers life cycle events (onRendererXXXX) have the renderer as parameter. In 1.9, an event is passed as parameter. This event will provide the renderer but also the view where this renderer is used and for "rendererCreated" and "rendererReused" events the data item displayed by this renderer.

  * Better support of asynchronous stores. Interactive event creation is now working with asynchronous stores (event is added to store at the end of the gesture). Event renderers are notified of the current store state (being created but not added yet to store, being added/updated, in store). An example is available (tests/asynchStore.html)

  * New properties have been added to further customize the the row header of the column view.

dojox/gfx
---------

   * Add dashed stroke support to canvas renderer. If the browser implements the (new) HTML5 dash api (context2d.setLineDash()) then the gfx renderer uses it. Otherwise, it relies on a custom (canvas- specific) implementation.

Migration Notes
===============

Dijit Calendar
--------------
To avoid accessibility violations the Calendar template changed so that the month name and arrows, plus the
previous/current/next year, are not contained within the TABLE node.   CSS was correspondingly changed.
