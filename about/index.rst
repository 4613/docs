Welcome to Dojo Toolkits new official documentation pages.

The documentation is aiming to cover all dojo modules delivered within a release. 

This is an open effort for anyone interested to join. If you are missing things or have ideas, don't hesitate to contact the documentation team or - better - read the Documentation guidelines and start to insert your own bits of knowledge.

Please read the `documentation howto <howto>`_. before starting writing docs

Search the docs
===============

Use the search box, it is very helpful and usually brings you to the page you need. If you are for example looking for "dojo.data.ItemFileReadStore" simply enter "itemfilereadstore".
